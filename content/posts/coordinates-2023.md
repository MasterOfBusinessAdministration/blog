However, in reality the lending rate offered by banks and Financial Institutes are between 20 to 28 % annually. Surprisingly, this rate is even more than 36% per year in private sector which is come through the very unstable country growth financially and high inflation rate.

_Note:_ interest rate charged by banks on loans to private sector customers minus the interest rate paid by commercial or similar banks for demand, time, or savings deposits
