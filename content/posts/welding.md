## Regional Steel Market

Over the past couple of years, commercial important improvement and
considerable trading activities has been seen in steel market in the
region of Middle East and North Africa. The main reason for this
attractive improvement is the large amount of oil revenue and
significant growth in related industries which increases the consumption
of steel and makes the region as one of the main global steel business
targets for consumers, producers, traders and investors.
On the other hand, and following to the better income through the
significant increase in energy price, demand of huge instruction projects
have been boosted and dramatically improved in this region.

## Steel Market in Iran

In 2013 Iran as a major Middle East steel producer stood as 15th Steel
producers in the world. After Turkey , Iran stands at 2nd place in the
region.
The consumption of these products are also the same with a very small
differences in volume but many differences in kind.


## Market Size

| Steel Structure Plants 	| , 	| 1,042 Units 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Steel Structure Capacity 	| , 	| 4,000,000 Metric Tone 	|
| Average Steel Price R Structural Use 	| , 	| ≈ 650 $ / Per Metric Tones 	|
| Structural Manufacturing Costs 	| , 	| 500~750 $ / Per Metric Tones 	|
| Steel Structure Market  Value 	| , 	| $ 4.6 Bill ~ $ 5.6 Bill  	|


## Distribution

## Distribution Channels

Trading and reselling methods are quite complicated in Iran and in
many case, there are lots of different scenarios and many hidden
money exchanges. the main reason is the presence of black market
and its continuous effects during last decades and very unstable market
condition.
Anyway, the following diagram is the most common method:

![]({{<baseurl>}}/navid/welding/1.3.jpg)

•Group 1: Wholesaler ( Importer, Agents, Agent/ Distributors etc.)
This sector is mainly concluded from the companies who are receiving
their goods or services directly from the suppliers or in some conditions,
lead the direction of sales to the main importers. These companies
formulate the sales strategies and distribution policies to the final sales
points. Profit margin of these companies is %10 in average but this
amount is highly dependent to product and varies from 4-5% to even
15-20%.

•Group 2 : Primary Distributers ( Regional/Province distributers,
Local distributers etc.)
Depends on market scale and product nature the number of companies
in this stage is different. This group of distributors receives a bulk
loading of products from group 1 and then break it down to smaller
volume and deliver the goods to local distributers.
generally speaking, profit is not more than %10 - %15. The main
reason is that their own stock is not involved with the business directly
and consequently they are not facing big risk of money back.

• Group 3 : Retailers ( Retailers, Shops, dealers etc.)
This stage consists of very varied type of sellers who provide their
consumers demands from group 1 or 2. The expected profit in this
stage is about %10 -%15.
The mentioned sale scenario can be change depends on consumer
nature and order volume. For example if the consumer is governmental
companies or the order volume is as high that the overhead charges
through the normal distribution channel would highly effect the final
price the consumers desire to make direct connections to upper hand
sectors in a market to procure their product directly which leads to their
lower final price.


## Welding Processes

### The major Processes used in Iran

•Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW)
•Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW-MIG&MAG)
Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)
•Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW-TIG)

### Welding Consumables

Manufacturing records and experiments shows the amount of welding
materials required in different types reaches to around %3 of final
product weight.
The table bellow shows an estimation of required welding materials
which are officially reported by governmental authorities.

|   | Welding Consumble |   |
|---|:---:|---|
| SMAW | 35 % | 42000 |
| GMAW | 35 % | 42000 |
| GTAW | 5% | 6000 |
| Other | 5% | 6000 |
| **Total** | | **120000** |

*Welding Material Requirement depends on welding technology in metric tones*

## Actual Market Size

Mentioned figures are based on nominal production capacities declared
by structure manufacturers/fabricators to the government.
However, in reality the market demand is about 70,000 MT of welding
products for structural fabrication and about 75,000 to 80,000 MT for
other industrial requirements.
The amount of welding consumable being produced by local
manufacturers is about 100,000 to 110,000 MT annually.

### The most important manufacturers are as below:
W AMA industrial group
W Aria Noorin Joosh (MIKA)
W Kavoush Joosh
W Tik Tak
W Yazd Electrode

### Importation Size
Importation of similar products:
30,377 metric tones
China has the largest share of this
amount which is about 24,000 MT.

### Common Welding Consumable
•SMAW:
•E6013, E6010, E7024 and E7018
•Sizes: 3.25 mm, 4.00 mm and 5.00 mm.

•GMAW :
•ER70S
•Sizes: 0.80 mm,1 mm and 1.2 mm

•SAW:
•EM12 and EL12
•Size 4.00 mm and 5.00 mm
•Fluxes Powder: F7A0, F7A2

### Forecast

Statistical research from recent years records shows that
manufacturing capacities has about %12 growth annually.
With this approach we can estimate about 13,000,000 metric tones
steel products in year 2020 which about 5,600,000 Metric tones is
related to the field of steel structure. As one can see 1,600,000 MT is
going to be added to the current market volume that could be
considered as a new market in our calculations.
