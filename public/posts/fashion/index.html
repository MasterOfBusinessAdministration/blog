After the market recovered in 2021 from the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, high inflation in 2022 posed more difficulties for the global apparel industry. The cost of production rose, and consumer confidence fell. The revenue of the global apparel market was calculated to amount to 1.53 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022, a slight decrease on the previous year. However, revenue was forecast to increase in 2023, to more than 1.7 trillion dollars. Revenue in the Apparel segment is projected to reach US$1,022.00m in 2023. Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2027) of 20.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$2,160.00m by 2027. With a projected market volume of US$166,400.00m in 2023, most revenue is generated in China. In the Apparel segment, the number of users is expected to amount to 40.9m users by 2027. User penetration will be 37.4% in 2023 and is expected to hit 44.7% by 2027.

In that year, Chanel was the ninth most valuable luxury brand worldwide with a brand value of about 53 billion U.S. dollars.\nLuxury goods\nThe global luxury goods industry, which includes drinks, fashion, cosmetics, fragrances, watches, jewelry, luggage and handbags, has been on an upward climb for many years. Although the technical term ’luxury good’ is independent of the goods’ quality, they are generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price. Luxury goods manufacturers meet consumer demand by focusing on brand, aesthetics, quality materials, superior craftsmanship and pricing to transform everyday objects into status symbols. The industry rises and falls with the gross domestic product (GDP), seeing demand climb in times of economic stability and plummeting in unfavourable economic climates. The United States has long been the largest regional market for luxury goods and it was estimated to continue to be the leading personal luxury goods market in 2020, with a value of 55 billion euros.\nLVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) was the most valuable luxury brand in the world, with a brand value of about 124.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. The LVMH Group’s total revenue for the 2021 fiscal year was about 64.2 billion euros. Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, more commonly referred to as LVMH Group, is a French luxury goods conglomerate. The company is primarily known for its fashion house, known as Louis Vuitton, named after its founder. The conglomerate operates globally, selling luxury leather goods, handbags, ready-to-wear fashion, and other fashion accessories. Since 1989, the company has been run by Frenchman Bernard Arnault, following the merger of the luxury goods producer with champagne producer Moët \u0026 Chanson and cognac manufacturer Hennessy.\nNew markets and segments are giving the industry growth points. One challenge for luxury companies is to maintain brand equity and cultivate their customer relationships. As luxury expands into more industries, expect a more mature segmented market. As a result, consumers should also become more rational. Discussions around the fashion industry issues are complex and important. Its impact on the environment, society and economics are huge. The fashion industry statistics show that the apparel and textile sector is the 4th biggest in the world. But do you have any idea of what that means? Keep reading to find out the most important numbers about it. FASHION INDUSTRY STATISTICS: GENERAL DATA According to Fashion United, the industry has a labour force of 3,384.1 million. Its value is equivalent to 3 trillion dollars. That means, it corresponds to 2% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Joint Economic Committee of The United States released a survey in 2019 affirming that, only in the US, consumers spent nearly $380 billion on apparel and footwear. The industry, which encompasses everything from textile and apparel brands to wholesalers, importers and retailers, employs more than 1.8 million people in the country. Its numbers have only grown and the post-pandemic scenario is optimistic. The fashion industry continues to have positive growth, especially in emerging markets within the Western, Asian, and European regions. Regarding the Asian market exclusively, it was forecast to have a 38% share of global apparel demand in the past year. FASHION INDUSTRY STATISTICS: THE COMPANIES To have a broad view, 3,000 billion textile and garment companies are entering the market daily. Most of these companies remain unknown to the bigger part of consumers. Even though, that doesn’t mean they don’t thrive in their community and circle. In 2021, China was the top ranked global clothing exporter with a share of approximately 32.8 percent, followed by the European Union, Bangladesh, and Viet Nam. In that year, China and the European Union were also the leading textile exporters in the world.\nApparel and clothing market in Europe Europe has one of the most lucrative apparel and clothing markets in the world. In 2018, specialized clothing stores in the European Union generated more than 222 billion euros in turnover from retail sales, but had a downturn in 2019. Between 2011 and 2019, the number of clothing and footwear retail stores in the European Union has decreased, despite steady increase in turnover from retail sales during this time period. This could be attributable to the key role e-commerce came to play in the apparel market in Europe and beyond. In 2019, there were some 275 thousand stores specializing in clothing and around 57 thousand footwear and leather goods stores in the EU.\nLeading clothing retailers in Europe Europe is home to some of the world’s most famous clothing retailers and brands. The Spanish apparel company Inditex was the leading fashion retailer in Europe, with a turnover of 12.9 billion euros in 2020. Inditex is the mother company of iconic brands such as Zara, Bershka, Stradivarius, Massimo Dutti, Pull\u0026Bear and more. The Swedish H\u0026M (Hannes and Mauritz) followed in second place, with a similar turnover of around 12.5 billion euros. The German fashion retailer Zalando came in third place, with roughly 8 billion euros in annual turnover in 2020. A brand value comparison between H\u0026M and Zara shows that the Swedish retailer’s brand value was consistently higher than Zara’s between 2010 and 2017. By 2018, Zara had overtaken H\u0026M and as of 2022, has a higher brand value than that of H\u0026M In 2021, the EU was the top ranked global clothing importer with a total share of more than a third of total imports, followed by the U.S. and Japan.\nIRAN Local brand representatives at the fourth edition of the Iran Retail Show, held at the Tehran International Exhibition Centre from July 24 to 27, signalled their intention to expand across the country, filling the vacuum left by international labels. According to Shahrokh Keshavarz, director of the exhibition featuring 105 domestic companies — 30 percent of which were clothing retailers — and regional Iran market representative of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centres and Retailers, the aim of the event is to provide a physical platform for B2B activities and to help develop the market for participating brands. Over the past ten years, international sanctions against Iran have impacted Iranian fashion and retail businesses in many ways. Both industries have faced an increasingly unstable and unpredictable economic environment, due largely to sanctions imposed by the UN, the US and the EU over Iran’s uranium enrichment programme. But there have been advantages as well as disadvantages for some Iranian fashion players. Despite sanctions and other challenges like rising costs, the number of Iranian clothing retail branches around the country has risen sharply over the last decade. Sam Zarrabi, a retail industry consultant who has previously worked with international brands such as Mango, explains that ”the existence of a suitable environment after the departure of foreign brands has made it possible for [local] brands to expand in the country and take a larger share of the market…[though] this is [only] possible if the brands have also invested in their commitment to serving customers.” In Tehran, for example, the upmarket Bamland shopping mall initially operated with the aim of serving foreign brand tenants such as Geox, Nike and Mango, but it replaced more than 90 percent of its tenants with Iranian brands in a short period of time. The combined annual turnover of Bamland and other large shopping centres owned by the same company, has now reached the threshold of $94 to 125 million dollars, according to Ali Eslami, CEO of Bamland Tourism Business Complex. A member of the Board of Directors of the Iran Textile and Apparel Production and Export Union, stating that the value of clothing exports from Iran is 130 to 140 million dollars annually, said: The government says that the way to save the country is export, but it does not provide the facilities and Iranian manufacturers face many problems, including export tariffs. And they face the cost of transferring money. Majid Eftekhari, a member of the Board of Directors of the Union of Clothing Manufacturers and Sellers, said: “The government tells us why you don’t export clothes to Russia?” While it should be noted that there are markets in the field of export whose diplomatic relations with Iran are suitable, but the export conditions in our country are complicated. He stated that the competing manufacturers in Turkey and China have the ability to export with much better conditions, and clarified: Turkish and Chinese manufacturers export clothes to Russia with zero tariffs, they have eight to 20% incentives, they can open an LC, and there are no problems and costs. Iranian producers do not have the banking system to transfer money.\n","wordCount":"1667","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://mbatalks.ir/blog/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2023-02-28T13:08:28+03:30","dateModified":"2023-02-28T13:08:28+03:30","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Atiyeh Hosseini"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mbatalks.ir/blog/posts/fashion/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"MBA Community Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mbatalks.ir/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mbatalks.ir/blog accesskey=h title="MBA Community Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://mbatalks.ir/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>MBA Community Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mbatalks.ir/blog/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mbatalks.ir/blog/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mbatalks.ir title=mbatalks.ir><span>mbatalks.ir</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mbatalks.ir/blog>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mbatalks.ir/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Fashion</h1><div class=post-description>&lt;description text></div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-28 13:08:28 +0330 +0330'>February 28, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1667 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Atiyeh Hosseini&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/masterofbusinessadministration/blog/tree/main/content/posts/fashion.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Fashion market
